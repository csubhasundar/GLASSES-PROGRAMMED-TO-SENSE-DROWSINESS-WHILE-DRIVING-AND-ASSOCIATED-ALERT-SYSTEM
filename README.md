# GLASSES-PROGRAMMED-TO-SENSE-DROWSINESS-WHILE-DRIVING-AND-ASSOCIATED-ALERT-SYSTEM
WE ALL DRIVE SOME MODE OF TRANSPORT OR THE OTHER NOW A DAYS BUT WHAT CONCERNS US IS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF DRIVERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE THUS PLAN TO DEVELOP A SMART GLASS WHICH WILL HELP US AND ALL THE DRIVERS AROUND THE WORLD TO ATTAIN SAFETY WHILE DRIVING


# Problem Statement:-
An estimated 1 in 25 adult drivers (aged 18 years or older) report having fallen asleep while driving in the previous 30 days.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy driving was responsible for 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries, and 800 deaths in 2013. However, these numbers are underestimated and up to 6,000 fatal crashes each year may be caused by drowsy drivers.  Nearly 7000 drivers died in India due to drowsiness during driving according to NSF AND 40% OF ADULT DRIVERS ADMIT BEING FEELING DROWSY DURING DRIVING_
# Solution: -
The glasses and closure of eyelids and hence a person feel sleepy it might wake him up with the buzzer or sound module alert system that we plan to install. Therefore, a lot of accidents might be prevented by avoiding incidences to drowsy driving 

## 1. The glasses can sense the closure of eyelids and hence a person feels sleepy it might wake him up with the buzzer or sound module alert system that we plan to install. Therefore, a lot of accidents might be prevented by avoiding incidences to drowsy driving.
## 2. The glasses can sense this closure of eyelids for more than a few seconds so that the sound module doesn’t beep every time someone blinks the eye.
## 3. The alert system is a simple one comprising of a powerful but yet reliable sound module. In our prototype it is a simple buzzer module.
## 4. we also plan to install a solar backup system for drivers engaged in long trips.
